I am giving courses on different flavours of organizational modeling since around 2012. My main focus area has been business process modeling, about which I have also contributed to two monographs targeting practicioners and students of information systems and organizational sciences. Aside this, I've started giving courses in the field of enterprise architecting since around 2015. In the course of introduction level courses to information systems, I also regularly teach data modeling fundamentals.
