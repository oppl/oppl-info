In my current position as a professor for technology-enhanced learning, I started developing and giving courses on media support for collaborative learning support since 2019. These courses cover topics of media production and tool selection for synchronous and asynchronous learning scenarios at higher eduction institutions, schools and in informal learning settings in organizations.
