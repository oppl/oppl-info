I am teaching distributed systems from both, a technical and a socio-technical perspective since around 2012. In technically oriented courses, I am focusing on the fundamentals of network technology and Internet protocols, as well as traditional distributed communication mechanisms (such as RPC, REST, etc.) and more recent developments (e.g., blockchain). When focusing on the socio-technical dimension of distributed systems, I usually augment the technical aspects described above with accounts on computer-supported collaborative work, enterprise architecting, or web-based information systems.
