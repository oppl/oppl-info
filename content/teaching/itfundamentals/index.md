Since around 2007, I am teaching introduction level courses on diverse IT topics for students in management curricula. I have covered a large variety of courses in this area, ranging from introduction to programming over data management to IT security. I mainly focus on enabling students to understand and communicate with IT professionals and act as translators between business and IT in their own organizations.
