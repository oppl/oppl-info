Progressive digitization is noticeably changing the way we live, learn and work, so that this technological change also requires altered qualifications as well as lifelong learning. The project "DigiFit4All" aims within the framework of the cluster "Computer Science Education" to impart the necessary competencies digitally and in a form tailored for different user groups (pupils, teachers, general employees, students as well as generally interested people). Technical foundations for "Personalized Open Online Courses" (POOCs) will be laid to enable digital continuing education with learning platforms widely used in Austria (e.g. Moodle and iMooX). Each of the teaching and learning aids developed in the project are tagged with metadata and stored as Open Educational Resources (OER) in a suitable project repository or connected to the subject portal "Open Education Austria". For the selected competency areas, existing national and international competency models serve as a basis. The optimal learning paths are calculated individually, based on a graph model.

The project makes time- and location-independent, personalized learning activities possible and thus facilitates access to digital key competencies

for groups of people with specific requirements. The resulting digital learning resources are stored in an open project repository in a sustainable manner and provided with metadata and are thus available as a basis for future further developments and optimizations in the field of learning analytics.

In this project, the University for Continuing Education Krems cooperates with the University of Klagenfurt, the TU Wien (University of Technology Vienna), and the Johannes Kepler University Linz.
