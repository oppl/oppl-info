As today’s businesses become more and more data-intensive, a competent handling of technologies for data-based decision-making, e.g. artificial intelligence (AI) which prepares or makes business decisions, increasingly becomes a key competence in the economy. Against this background, the main objective of DDM4SME is to develop and provide comprehensive education on Data-Driven Management. Thereby, the project bridges a gap in the educational landscape, provides learners with knowledge and skills that, in a data economy, are highly relevant in the labour market and fosters competitiveness specifically for SMEs and Start-ups. The main outcomes (Intellectual Outouts) of the project will be: IO1: Curriculum for a Multidisciplinary Master Program on DDM in SMEs and Start-Ups IO2: Guideline on Didactics, Evaluation and Sustainable Improvement of the Master Program IO3: Full-Featured Course Modules and Teaching Resources IO4: Transdisciplinary Handbook on “DDM in SMEs and Start-ups” The project consortium consists of Danube-University Krems Masaryk University Brno (Czeck Republic) Mykolas Romeris University Vilnius (Lithuania) Georg August University Göttingen (Germany) Project Duration: 2020-09-01 - 2023-08-31 (36 months)
