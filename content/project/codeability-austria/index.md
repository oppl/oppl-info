CodeAbility is a project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, which aims to create teaching and learning environments for programming education for students of all subjects in order to enable high-quality and individual programming education.

Requirements for high-quality programming education are becoming more and more important as digitization continues to advance. Besides increasing student numbers, universities are also challenged by heterogeneity in prior knowledge and a shortage of teaching staff.

The project stands on three pillars:

* Development of didactic concepts
* Use of learning analytics to enable individual learning paths, among other things
* Networking of teachers and institutions

A programming learning platform and associated teaching and learning materials, including a didactic concept, will be developed as part of the project. This didactic concept will be a combination of classroom and virtual learning forms and adapt learning speeds individually to the students. In this way, drop-out rates will also be kept low. As Open Educational Resources (OERs), the teaching materials developed in the project will be made available to a broad public.
