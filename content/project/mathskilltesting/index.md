To successfully accomplish a course of study in the STEM field (natural science, technology, engineering, mathematics), students must have basic knowledge and skills as well as an understanding of mathematics. Nevertheless, these skills and abilities differ among interested students because of different types of schools and individually differing mathematical emphases in the teaching field. It is intended that the validation, development, and established possibility to a more flexible and more profound measurement and more precise assessment of these basic prerequisites will lead to recording these individually and differently existing abilities and to promote them accordingly in a supportive manner through supplementary and deepening teaching and learning offers.

The project aims to facilitate and standardize access to STEM subjects (natural science, technology, engineering, mathematics) by providing prospective students with in-depth teaching and learning support. In doing so, their chances of successfully completing their studies are increased and, in addition, turn into an attractive public perception of the STEM subjects.

The University of Continuing Education Krems is cooperating with Johannes Kepler University Linz in this project.
