 abstract = {Digital Montessori-inspired Manipulatives (MiMs) so far have been used effectively for knowledge transfer in elementary educational settings. For work modeling and task-based interactive systems design we propose a modeling concept and usage scenario that should help to increase effectiveness in organization and technology development. The Tangible Task Modeling Demonstrator (TTMD) facili- tates the representation and development of work and task models by means of MiMs. Using the TTMD users can directly grasp and manipulate work tasks. As a result, the cognitive load for modeling and (re-)arranging elements of work spaces can be reduced.},
