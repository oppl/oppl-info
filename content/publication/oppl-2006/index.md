abstract: Digital Montessori-inspired Manipulatives (MiMs) so far have been used effectively
  for knowledge transfer in elementary educational settings. For work modeling and
  task-based interactive systems design we propose a modeling concept and usage scenario
  that should help to increase effectiveness in organization and technology development.
  The Tangible Task Modeling Demonstrator (TTMD) facili- tates the representation
  and development of work and task models by means of MiMs. Using the TTMD users can
  directly grasp and manipulate work tasks. As a result, the cognitive load for modeling
  and (re-)arranging elements of work spaces can be reduced.
