abstract: In this chapter, business enablers and resources are at the center of interest,
  as they are required to generate valuable assets for the market. Looking at those
  elements beyond a requirements engineering perspective to deliver products and services,
  human-centric value chain and their analysis can help in apprehending how an enterprise
  creates valuable elements through a set of core and support activities. Both are
  assumed to contribute to the sustainable existence of the producing organization
  in competitive and continuously changing environments, based on products or services
  for which customers are creating revenues. Representational carriers of work knowledge
  are business processes, as functional activities of work force transform goods and
  information. Value creation resides in the context-rich design and execution of
  work processes rather than the processed or created assets. Although value created
  in this way has a tangible component, a second component, the intangible part, is
  of equal importance. Both need to be externalized and represented for (re-)design.
  In this chapter, various methodologically grounded instruments are introduced, ranging
  from individual to collective elicitation, and tackling tangible and intangible
  transactions among concerned stakeholders.
