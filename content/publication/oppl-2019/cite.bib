 abstract = {In this chapter, business enablers and resources are at the center of interest, as they are required to generate valuable assets for the market. Looking at those elements beyond a requirements engineering perspective to deliver products and services, human-centric value chain and their analysis can help in apprehending how an enterprise creates valuable elements through a set of core and support activities. Both are assumed to contribute to the sustainable existence of the producing organization in competitive and continuously changing environments, based on products or services for which customers are creating revenues. Representational carriers of work knowledge are business processes, as functional activities of work force transform goods and information. Value creation resides in the context-rich design and execution of work processes rather than the processed or created assets. Although value created in this way has a tangible component, a second component, the intangible part, is of equal importance. Both need to be externalized and represented for (re-)design. In this chapter, various methodologically grounded instruments are introduced, ranging from individual to collective elicitation, and tackling tangible and intangible transactions among concerned stakeholders.},
