abstract: "'Interactive Acquisition, Negotiation and Enactment of Subject-oriented\
  \ Business Process Knowledge' is a 4-year research effort to implement a knowledge\
  \ life cycle using Subject-oriented Business Process Management and mutually align\
  \ related Organizational Learning techniques in respective develop- ment processes.\
  \ As different partners from academia and industry need to share their experiences,\
  \ tools, techniques on a detailed level as well as the project's con- tent management\
  \ are of crucial importance. In this paper, we focus on the Nym- phaea system as\
  \ a means for effective spatially distributed knowledge sharing. We develop the\
  \ requirements revisiting distributed transactive memory systems and describe the\
  \ toolset and its support for different aspects of knowledge sharing within the\
  \ project. We also report on initial findings when utilizing annotation fea- tures\
  \ for individualization and mutually changing perspectives."
