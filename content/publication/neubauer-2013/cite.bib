 abstract = {'Interactive Acquisition, Negotiation and Enactment of Subject-oriented Business Process Knowledge' is a 4-year research effort to implement a knowledge life cycle using Subject-oriented Business Process Management and mutually align related Organizational Learning techniques in respective develop- ment processes. As different partners from academia and industry need to share their experiences, tools, techniques on a detailed level as well as the project's con- tent management are of crucial importance. In this paper, we focus on the Nym- phaea system as a means for effective spatially distributed knowledge sharing. We develop the requirements revisiting distributed transactive memory systems and describe the toolset and its support for different aspects of knowledge sharing within the project. We also report on initial findings when utilizing annotation fea- tures for individualization and mutually changing perspectives.},
