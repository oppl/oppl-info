abstract: This chapter demonstrates the use of the proposed framework for digital
  work design and the embedded methods. It shows the mutual interplay of its components
  for articulating work knowledge, organizational learning, knowledge processing,
  and preserving design-relevant knowledge. The case studies describe the impact that
  could be generated through digital design support. The healthcare case demonstrates
  how meaningful work-model entities evolve in the course of articulation and guide
  aligned re-structuring of work. It stems from a complex planning process in clinical
  health treatment requiring the structured elicitation of contextual knowledge from
  all stakeholders involved to develop working procedures in time-critical situations.
  The CoMPArE/WP (Collaborative Model Articulation and Elicitation of Work Processes)-case
  has its focus on alignment when bridging from intuitive or semi-structured models
  to techno-centric (formal) models that can be executable for some workflow engine.
  The education case targets educator knowledge involving domain knowledge, didactic
  competence, and social skills. Finally, the Me2Me2You-case addresses mental model
  alignment of interaction behavior for executable workflow support from a cascaded
  interaction perspective.
