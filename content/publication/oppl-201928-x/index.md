abstract: This chapter introduces methodological support for transitioning from existing
  to envisioned work processes via direct actor involvement. It suggests direct actor
  involvement in the alignment and validation of novel work practices, in particular
  when digital workflows or instruments are involved that fundamentally impact the
  modes of individual operation and collaboration. Alignment is required for consolidating
  various inputs for further processing. In particular, actively involving process
  participants in process modeling creates a challenge for consolidated digital work
  design. Process participants are not expected to have modeling skills and usually,
  they prefer to externalize their knowledge through diagrams that are as simple as
  possible in terms of both syntax and semantics (‘natural modeling’). Alignment leads
  to accommodation of novel perspectives on a work process according to the participants’
  individual mental models, allowing their implementation in organizational practice
  after validation.
