 abstract = {Interactivity has become a crucial issue in most domain-specific applications. For content-rich applications navigation can be designed in a user-centered way utilizing metadata. In this way standard access facilities can be enriched using inherent domain structures. They enforce systemic understanding and support individualized learning management. In case the latter is enhanced through coupling communication facilities directly to content elements, learners can be encouraged to share individual perspectives on the provided content. In this paper we introduce and compare two different navigation design solutions that even can be used complementary. Learners appreciate the intertwining of linear browsing and association-based selection, as they need various structures to keep control over their learning process.},
