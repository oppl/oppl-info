abstract: Interactivity has become a crucial issue in most domain-specific applications.
  For content-rich applications navigation can be designed in a user-centered way
  utilizing metadata. In this way standard access facilities can be enriched using
  inherent domain structures. They enforce systemic understanding and support individualized
  learning management. In case the latter is enhanced through coupling communication
  facilities directly to content elements, learners can be encouraged to share individual
  perspectives on the provided content. In this paper we introduce and compare two
  different navigation design solutions that even can be used complementary. Learners
  appreciate the intertwining of linear browsing and association-based selection,
  as they need various structures to keep control over their learning process.
