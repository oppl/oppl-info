abstract: Inclusive Design of knowledge transfer aims to involve different learners
  and coaches into the transfer process of knowledge in a way that actively supports
  learning. In this paper we elaborate some benefits for learners and coaches when
  applying major principles of Maria Montessori along the transfer process of knowledge.
  Benefits stem from learners' self control and individualised learning experiences.
  We motivate the immersion of learners into physical and ambient transfer environments,
  and reveal first insights from testing those ideas. The results of our work should
  guide further developments of inclusive knowledge-transfer environments.
