abstract: The design of digital work systems requires stakeholder involvement in generating
  relevant work knowledge. It starts with articulation, and proceeds with sharing
  and aligning this knowledge in more or less structured design spaces. Once the ultimate
  goal is to develop executable processes in evolving systems, such as cyber-physical
  environments, specifications require stakeholders to become skilled in programming
  (concepts) for automated model execution. In this chapter, we demonstrate that models
  can be created on an abstract, implementation-independent level, while still being
  executable. The so-called ground models serve as boundary objects for iterative
  prototyping and interactive validation of specific process scenarios or situations.
  Remaining on this level of description allows tracing diagrammatic models while
  running their code, thus reducing system complexity to manageable components and
  architectures.
