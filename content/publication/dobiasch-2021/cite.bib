 abstract = {ePortfolio-platforms are popular tools to facilitate and promote lifelong learning. One of their major usage scenarios is enabling users to document
their learning outcomes in an institution-independent way beyond formal
learning settings. Aside this, ePorfolios are also promoted as a way to
facilitate qualitative assessment in courses. The latter scenario
introduces a short-term usage perspective that can be counterproductive for
establishing sustainable long-term usage practices. In this paper, we
analyse the usage data of the ePortfolio-platform mahara.at with respect to
the prevalent usage patterns. This instance was active from 2007 until 2019
and featured more than 22.000 users from nearly 200 different institutions.
As part of the analysis, we reviewed the activity on the platform on the
basis of users' login behaviour and content creation activities. Activity
data shows that ~ 50\% of the users used the platform for only half a year
and sustainable usage practices over longer durations of time can hardly be
observed. Both logins and content creations show cyclic patterns which
correspond to the academic year. Based on these indications we conclude
that users used the instance mainly for course-based scenarios rather than
as a lifelong-learning portfolio.},
