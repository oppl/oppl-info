abstract: Effective and successful support of collaborative process design in a distributed
  environment is largely dependent on the mutual intelligibility of processes for
  the involved parties. This requires an ICT- supported modelling framework that captures
  information provided by stakeholders and presents it in an accurate way to the other
  involved parties. We introduce a novel, distributed approach for process modelling,
  which allows to build abstract models of processes, business rules and constraints.
  The focus of this approach lays on enabling the creation of simple descriptions
  of enterprise internal proc- esses and supporting refinement when necessary. This
  paper presents the underlying novel modelling notation and a list of identified
  requirements and research questions for a framework that ensures intel- ligibility
  and allows to interconnect the individual models.
