abstract: The following case study shows how some of the previously described BPM
  concepts, methods and languages were used to improve a core process of a company.
  On the basis of the individual aspects of the open BPM cycle their instantiation
  and intertwining will be demonstrated as occurring in a real industrial development
  project. In the following, the course of the project is described in a structured
  way. The respective activities of the bundle of activities in Figure 8.1 are noted
  in the margin of the use case description. The activities of each activity bundle
  are not only carried out with a high degree of overlap, there are also frequent
  shifts with respect to the considered focus throughout the project.
