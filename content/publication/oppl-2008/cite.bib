 abstract = {Structure placement techniques have been successfully used to facilitate individual articulation and communication in organizational settings. Recent research provides evidence that tangible interfaces might further improve these processes. A tool to capture knowledge about human work has been developed based on these findings. Graspable Work Modeling allows people not trained in modeling to create representations of their work that facilitate reflection and communication. Users physically build their models using a tangible interface. The modeling process is supported by a set of tools that exploit the synchronous availability of physical and virtual representations of the model.},
