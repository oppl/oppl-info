abstract: Structure placement techniques have been successfully used to facilitate
  individual articulation and communication in organizational settings. Recent research
  provides evidence that tangible interfaces might further improve these processes.
  A tool to capture knowledge about human work has been developed based on these findings.
  Graspable Work Modeling allows people not trained in modeling to create representations
  of their work that facilitate reflection and communication. Users physically build
  their models using a tangible interface. The modeling process is supported by a
  set of tools that exploit the synchronous availability of physical and virtual representations
  of the model.
