abstract: We discuss the problems associated with the feasibility of fully automated
  systems in the domain of cross-organizational workflow development and present the
  outcomes of the CrossWork project in terms of necessity of human intervention in
  inter-organizational workflow formation. The points of intervention are shown and
  justified in detail along two use cases.
