abstract: Developing mathematical skills requires the opportunity to practice and
  receive immediate, individualized feedback on the misconceptions or mistakes made
  in the problem-solving process. Huge progress has been made in the last years in
  the design of feedback systems for fundamental math education. Applied mathematics
  education for engineering disciplines, however, lacks a large body of examples with
  pre-worked solution paths and known difficulty, which are necessary for providing
  learners with (semi-)automated feedback. This is mostly due to the need for domain-specific
  and situated tasks, which are not that widely deployable as generic items. The effort
  required for designing appropriate items, validating them in terms of the appropriateness
  for specific learning outcomes, and calibrating their difficulty cannot be borne
  by individual teachers and is also hardly justifiable for commercial providers of
  item pools. In this paper, we strive to show how these challenges can be addressed
  via a community approach to item design and calibration, supported by the methods
  from the computerized adaptive testing field.
