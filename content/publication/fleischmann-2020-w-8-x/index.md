abstract: The aim of the process preparation in the sense of a subsequent implementation
  is a precise description of the process with a description of the process strategy
  and process logic. The preparation includes the activity bundles on the left side
  of the open cycle, i.e., analysis, modeling, validation and optimization (see figure
  below). The result of these activity bundles is a process description that is sufficiently
  precise for implementation. The preparation is split into the activities analysis
  combined with modeling, validation, and optimization. These activities are not carried
  out in a strict order, but rather the respective priorities can change frequently
  between activities. Figure 6.1 shows these various activities and their relationships
