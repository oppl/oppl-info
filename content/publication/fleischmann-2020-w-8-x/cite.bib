 abstract = {The aim of the process preparation in the sense of a subsequent implementation is a precise description of the process with a description of the process strategy and process logic. The preparation includes the activity bundles on the left side of the open cycle, i.e., analysis, modeling, validation and optimization (see figure below). The result of these activity bundles is a process description that is sufficiently precise for implementation. The preparation is split into the activities analysis combined with modeling, validation, and optimization. These activities are not carried out in a strict order, but rather the respective priorities can change frequently between activities. Figure 6.1 shows these various activities and their relationships},
