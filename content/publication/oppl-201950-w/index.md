abstract: This chapter offers a synthesis of the conceptual and methodological considerations
  of the previously presented frameworks and instruments. It adjusts the methodological
  concepts for eliciting, representing, and processing work knowledge for practical
  use. Based on elementary modeling constructs we provide a unifying framework that
  guides the design of organizational interventions when enabling the emergence of
  novel digital workplace designs and work practices. According to the architecture,
  support systems for organizational learning enable augmenting processes with work-relevant
  knowledge, including the execution of specified behavior representations. Overall
  goal is developing consensually shared workflow designsâ€”developed for and by the
  actual set of people executing a workflow. The structured procedure allows a generalized
  architecture based on a common organizational memory and dedicated components for
  articulation, informed alignment through organizational learning support, and process
  prototyping.
