 abstract = {This chapter offers a synthesis of the conceptual and methodological considerations of the previously presented frameworks and instruments. It adjusts the methodological concepts for eliciting, representing, and processing work knowledge for practical use. Based on elementary modeling constructs we provide a unifying framework that guides the design of organizational interventions when enabling the emergence of novel digital workplace designs and work practices. According to the architecture, support systems for organizational learning enable augmenting processes with work-relevant knowledge, including the execution of specified behavior representations. Overall goal is developing consensually shared workflow designsâ€”developed for and by the actual set of people executing a workflow. The structured procedure allows a generalized architecture based on a common organizational memory and dedicated components for articulation, informed alignment through organizational learning support, and process prototyping.},
