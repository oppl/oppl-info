 abstract = {In the previous chapters we have considered the means for describing the sequence of activities executed in a process. In the course of digitalization, processes in an organization and, in particular across organizations, are becoming more complex. In order to describe them nonetheless in a transparent way, it is necessary to organize them as networks of processes, or as a hierarchy of subprocesses.},
