abstract: In the previous chapters we have considered the means for describing the
  sequence of activities executed in a process. In the course of digitalization, processes
  in an organization and, in particular across organizations, are becoming more complex.
  In order to describe them nonetheless in a transparent way, it is necessary to organize
  them as networks of processes, or as a hierarchy of subprocesses.
