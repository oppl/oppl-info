abstract: This chapter introduces methods to enable to act on the results of articulation
  and alignment processes. As such, it outlines paths towards sharing and anchoring
  new work practices in organizations. The proposed methodologically grounded interventions
  allow to qualitatively validate novel work practices and to agree on strategies
  for their organization-wide roll-out. Drawing from current practice-oriented research
  in organizational development, Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), and
  knowledge management, this chapter also includes an account on supporting technology
  that could be used to aid method deployment.
