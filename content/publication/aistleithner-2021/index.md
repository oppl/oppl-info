abstract: Nowadays people spend more and more time on their mobile phones and are
  always available for communication requests. How people deal with interruptions
  through various kinds of messages from different contexts in their lives is subject
  to boundary management. Studies suggested that polychronicity, the trait describing
  one's preference of handling multiple tasks simultaneously, has an impact on how
  individuals perceive and react to interruptions via digital communication media.
  This paper examines potential relations between a polychronic orientation and strategies
  used in boundary management. In an exploratory study, a method for boundary profiling
  was combined with a scale to measure the polychronic orientation of individuals.
  The results were examined for possible relationships between them and show that
  individuals with a polychronic orientation identify a lower number of contexts than
  individuals with a monochronic orientation. We could also find indications that
  polychronic individuals have a tendency to find interruptions from other contexts
  in their lives more acceptable than monochronic individuals.
