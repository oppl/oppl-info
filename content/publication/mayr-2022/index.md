abstract: Providing access to higher education for people in marginalized
  communities, in particular for refugees, requires to re-think the traditional
  ways of teaching and learning in higher education institutions. The challenges
  of these circumstances both in terms of access to learning materials and the
  opportunity to collaboratively learn with others require specific support via
  appropriate didactical settings. Blended learning arrangements, i.e., settings
  that bring together online learning activities with synchronous, co-located
  settings show potential for addressing these requirements. In the present
  study, we examine the success factors in the design of blended learning
  settings for supporting higher education in marginalized communities. Based on
  an established model of blended learning success, we explore the specific
  challenges of the target group via a survey which was distributed to students
  of different subject areas and of the higher education programs of Jesuit
  Worldwide Learning. The 80 survey participants analyzed in this paper live in
  refugee camps, or marginalized areas located in rural and remote areas in
  Afghanistan, Guyana, India, Iraq, Kenya, Malawi, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri
  Lanka and Thailand. While we could confirm the success factors that also apply
  for blended learning scenarios in traditional settings, we also found evidence
  for the crucial role of facilitation in both, online and co-located learning
  phases, and challenges regarding the access to suitable infrastructure. Both
  need to be considered during design of blended learning programs for this
  target group.
