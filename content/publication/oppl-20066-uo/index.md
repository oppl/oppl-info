abstract: Models of human work are well recognized means for representing multiple
  elements of an organization in a mutually tuned form. However, humans and systems
  tend to use different forms of representation when expressing their knowledge. Most
  of the widespread modelling approaches focus on a system designer's or software
  view rather than on intuitive and comprehensive (re)presentations of mental models
  of users. Tangible interfaces that support the modelling process in an intuitive
  way could help to reduce the cognitive load when leveraging individual mental models
  of work processes. In a collaborative setting the immediate and concurrent manipulation
  of model elements fosters the reflection and discussion of both modelling a work
  domain and corresponding processes. In this way, it facilitates the development
  of common views on work tasks and knowledge sharing.
