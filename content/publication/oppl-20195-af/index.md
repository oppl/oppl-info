abstract: This chapter instantiates the proposed framework for developing consensually
  shared workflow designs. It shows how the framework can be put to operation using
  instruments that have been successfully deployed in practice. These instruments
  enable articulation and alignment of work process knowledge, allow its representation
  and transfer within organizations, and facilitate acting on these representations
  for validation and implementation in diverse organizational settings. We here adopt
  an organizational learning perspective and situate the presented socio-technical
  instruments along a multi-perspective learning chain informed by the components
  of the framework. It thus offers instruments supporting the articulation and alignment
  of work process knowledge, its multi-faceted representation and flexible manipulation,
  as well as support for processing the resulting models for validation and refinement.
  Using the framework as a coherent lens on the requirements on support and the respective
  features of the instruments allows to offer an integrated view, which demonstrates
  digital work design support in organizational practice.
