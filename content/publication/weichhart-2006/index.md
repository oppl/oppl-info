abstract: In order to capture the increased complexity of products and production
  processes as well as market requirements, collaboration models representing organisational
  networks enable improvements at a process level. To bridge the gap between divergent
  goals of partners and to support distributed decision- making, novel collaboration
  frameworks are necessary. In this paper, we identify several requirements for such
  frameworks.
