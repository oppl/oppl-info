 abstract = {In order to capture the increased complexity of products and production processes as well as market requirements, collaboration models representing organisational networks enable improvements at a process level. To bridge the gap between divergent goals of partners and to support distributed decision- making, novel collaboration frameworks are necessary. In this paper, we identify several requirements for such frameworks.},
