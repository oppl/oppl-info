abstract: As today's group work today becomes more and more distributed across space
  and time, the demand for supporting group tasks by means of information technology
  is constantly growing. Available systems provide means for shared manipulation of
  objects and awareness about these manipulations. For effective teamwork, this artefact-based
  awareness is not enough. Awareness of what the other group members are currently
  engaged with, where they are and if they could be reached significantly improves
  the experience of computer supported collaborative work. Going even one step further,
  this user-based awareness could be used to provide the computer system with the
  context of the users and of the whole groups they are working in. Using this context,
  applications can adapt to the user's current needs and even proactively trigger
  services appropiate for the current situation. The goal of this thesis has been
  to evaluate how user contexts can be utilized to support interaction in groups in
  spatially bounded areas, namely university campuses, and to prototypically implement
  an application, which actively supports people in their interaction needs. The result
  of this work is a fully implemented system for the context-aware support of group
  interaction that is referred to as GISS (Group Interaction Support System). This
  system is based on the SiLiCon-Context-Framework (cf. chapter 5.2) and uses an already
  existing in- stant messenger as user interface (cf. chapter 5.4.3). The system is
  aware of user identities, locations and activity states and of the local time. Utilizing
  this knowledge about the user's context together with meta-information about group
  structures, the system is able to provide the users with pro-active services they
  might need to improve their interaction. These services include means for group
  formation and management, synchronous and asyn- chronous group communication, location
  awareness and the recognition and support of gath- erings as well as means for context-aware
  adaptation of one's availability status and a con- text-aware reminder service.
  The system has reached a stable version and has already been tested in several artificial
  set- tings. A field test with more users in a real life setting is subject of future
  work.
