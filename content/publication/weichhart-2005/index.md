abstract: Inter-organisational cooperation holds a huge potential for exploiting opportunities
  of dynamical, globalised markets -- especially for SMEs. Furthermore, today's ICT
  potentially allows for quick exchange of information and for coordinating activities.
  However, state of the art software architectures and technologies also hamper cross-organisational
  interoperability. A technologically determined need for extremely detailed modelling
  of business processes is a significant obstacle for establishing coordinated processes,
  a pre-requirement for scheduling and control in organisational networks. An approach
  that achieves the exploitation of technological potentials for efficient and effective
  cross- organisational processes without hampering flexibility is still to be developed.
  It requires both, a simpler modelling and with it an easier adaptability of ICT
  on the one hand and a better integration of human factors on the other hand. This
  paper reflects on existing ICT technologies for cooperation, collaboration and coordination
  and identifies gaps and further research opportunities.
