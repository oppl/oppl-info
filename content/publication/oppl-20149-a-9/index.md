abstract: As work is an inherently cooperative phenomenon, it requires a common understanding
  of the nature of collaboration for all involved parties. In this way, explicit articulation
  work becomes an integral and essential part of collaboration. Implicit aspects of
  collaboration have impact on the quality of work results, mainly through social
  norms and observations of working together. Eliciting those aspects interactively
  helps in avoiding (mutual) misrepresentations and lack of understanding. Tangible
  articulation support systems allow aligning mental models of how work should be
  carried out. Stakeholders can develop a common understanding of collaboration in
  a semantically open and non-intrusive way. They are not burdened by explication
  features and diagrammatic notations. We have utilised experiences with model-centred
  learning theory to support explicit articulation work. According to our field studies,
  the resulting models can be fed back to current work practices and help in preventing
  problematic work situations.
