abstract: "Over the last decades, a shift towards participatory approaches could
  be observed in cultural heritage institutions. In co-curation processes,
  museums collaborate with public audiences to identify, select, prepare, and
  interpret cultural materials. This article focuses on the question how to
  engage and motivate local communities or individuals in rethinking dominant
  discourses or expert narratives regarding cultural heritage and bringing in
  their own experiences and knowledge. Based on four case studies of cultural
  co-curation, we delineate two basic challenges for this process: (1)
  Authority—even though museums strive to involve the public, there is still an
  imbalance in participation due to the museums’ authoritative status. (2)
  Motivation—participation in co-curation processes requires high levels of
  motivation, which are difficult to achieve. Based on the media synchronicity
  theory, we discuss which characteristics of new media technologies can be
  helpful to overcome these challenges. Media can increase awareness on
  counternarratives and blind spots in cultural collections. They can provide a
  setting where the participants can easily contribute, feel competent to do so,
  are empowered to rethink dominant discourses, develop a sense of relatedness
  with other contributors, and maintain autonomy in how and to which degree they
  engage in the discourse."
