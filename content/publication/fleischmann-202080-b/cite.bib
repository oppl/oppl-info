 abstract = {With the specification of effective and efficient processes, the foundation for their implementation has been laid. Following these preparatory activities, we now deal with the implementation of process specifications in an execution environment and the handling of process instances in live operation. The implementation of a process specification as an executable process comprises the activity bundles organizational implementation, IT implementation and operation including monitoring. Figure 7.1 shows the classification of these activities in the process management model.},
