abstract: In the previous chapter we outlined the various aspects of Business Process
  Management. Since models are often used in practice to describe these aspects, the
  following sections will first look in more detail at the tasks and properties of
  models and modeling. We then present examples of models from various areas of expertise
  that in our experience have proven helpful in numerous Business Process Management
  projects. There is no claim to completeness for this exposition, but it can serve
  as an orientation for the reader when needing to choose description models for individual
  project needs.
