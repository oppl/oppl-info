 abstract = {In the previous chapter we outlined the various aspects of Business Process Management. Since models are often used in practice to describe these aspects, the following sections will first look in more detail at the tasks and properties of models and modeling. We then present examples of models from various areas of expertise that in our experience have proven helpful in numerous Business Process Management projects. There is no claim to completeness for this exposition, but it can serve as an orientation for the reader when needing to choose description models for individual project needs.},
