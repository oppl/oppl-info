abstract: Concept Mapping is a method for externalizing and reflecting knowledge about
  real world phenomena. In cooperative settings, concept maps can also be used to
  aid cooperative learning activities and the development of a common understanding
  about the mapping subject. This process imposes requirements on tool support that
  have hardly been addressed in existing concept mapping tools. In this paper, we
  present a tabletop interface designed to meet these requirements. In an empirical
  study, the positive effects on the cooperative mapping process facilitated by the
  proposed system have been shown in comparison to a traditional, screen-based system.
