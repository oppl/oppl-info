abstract: Elicitation of business process knowledge can be facilitated by visualization
  of conceptual process models. Models of collaborative business processes with actors
  participating in different roles are com- plex constructs with flows of individual
  activities that are coupled via acts of communication. The processes of elicitation
  in such cases can benefit from separating the modeling process for each role and
  let ac- tors focus on their own contribution to work and their communication with
  other roles. This paper identifies concepts for model visualization and modeling
  support that enable a modeling process distributed across role while maintaining
  one consistent overall model representation. A prototypical implementation of these
  concepts using distributed tangi- ble tabletop interfaces is presented and results
  of exploratory tests are discussed. Based on this results the introduced concepts
  are refined end extended together with an industry partner to create a table top
  device which can be used in real world model elicitation scenarios.
