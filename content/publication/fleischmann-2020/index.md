abstract: There is no organization without processes. When people want to collaborate,
  they use the necessary tools and coordinate their activities to reach the desired
  result. Since such activities can not only be carried out by humans, but also by
  machines and computers, their activities must also be included when aligning human
  requirements and technical capabilities. In particular, different types of actors
  are involved in at least partially automated processes.
