abstract: This chapter motivates the objective for introducing support measures and
  instruments for articulating, aligning, and enacting performative aspects of organizational
  work. It provides background information on supporting organizational actors to
  actively design their collaborative work processes. Of main interest are individual
  conceptualizations of work while ensuring syntactically correct and semantically
  valid work models to be processed by digital means. The chapter presents relevant
  framework constituents, namely humans, technology, and organization of work, while
  referring to the articulation and alignment processes by socio-technical means.
  From a dynamic system development perspective, learning support and human-centered
  representation of knowledge play a crucial role. Their major characteristics are
  discussed as common ground for the instruments presented in the subsequent chapters.
