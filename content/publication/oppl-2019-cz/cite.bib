 abstract = {This chapter motivates the objective for introducing support measures and instruments for articulating, aligning, and enacting performative aspects of organizational work. It provides background information on supporting organizational actors to actively design their collaborative work processes. Of main interest are individual conceptualizations of work while ensuring syntactically correct and semantically valid work models to be processed by digital means. The chapter presents relevant framework constituents, namely humans, technology, and organization of work, while referring to the articulation and alignment processes by socio-technical means. From a dynamic system development perspective, learning support and human-centered representation of knowledge play a crucial role. Their major characteristics are discussed as common ground for the instruments presented in the subsequent chapters.},
