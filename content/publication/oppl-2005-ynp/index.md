abstract: Bridging the gap between individual mental models of stakeholders and organizational
  or software developers requires a diagrammatic acquisition and representation scheme
  that captures information provided by stakeholders in an accurate way for all involved
  parties. In this paper we reflect an action research approach for deriving such
  a scheme, and revisit existing approaches in the light of our developments. Since
  human-centered diagrammatic representation schemes need to ensure the intelligibility
  of process knowledge, they have to provide dedicated modeling elements, such as
  contextual information types.
