abstract: In the previous chapters, we have shown that what happens in organizations
  (companies, administrations, etc.) is based on models from various disciplines.
  Business models, which represent enterprise architectures with models for products
  and services, organizational structure, processes, data and IT infrastructure, describe
  in which area a company does business, how it does this, which exchange relationships
  it has with partners, which technical infrastructure it is supported by, etc.
