I am a full professor of technology enhanced learning at the Department of Continuing Education Research and Educational Technologies at the Danube University Krems, Austria. I studied computer science and applied knowledge management and did my PhD in computer science at the Technical University Vienna in 2010. I have been an assistant/associate professor of business informatics at Johannes Kepler University Linz from 2010 to 2019. 

I coordinated the FP7-founded research project IANES, the Leonardo-da-Vinci Transfer-of-Innovation project FARAW and the Erasmus IP SURGEOM between 2010 and 2015. In 2016/17, I have been a visiting research fellow at Radboud University Nijmegen.
