title = {{Context-aware Group-Interaction}}, 
author = {Oppl, Stefan}, 
abstract = {{As today's group work today becomes more and more distributed across space and time, the demand for supporting group tasks by means of information technology is constantly growing. Available systems provide means for shared manipulation of objects and awareness about these manipulations. For effective teamwork, this artefact-based awareness is not enough. Awareness of what the other group members are currently engaged with, where they are and if they could be reached significantly improves the experience of computer supported collaborative work. Going even one step further, this user-based awareness could be used to provide the computer system with the context of the users and of the whole groups they are working in. Using this context, applications can adapt to the user's current needs and even proactively trigger services appropiate for the current situation. The goal of this thesis has been to evaluate how user contexts can be utilized to support interaction in groups in spatially bounded areas, namely university campuses, and to prototypically implement an application, which actively supports people in their interaction needs. The result of this work is a fully implemented system for the context-aware support of group interaction that is referred to as GISS (Group Interaction Support System). This system is based on the SiLiCon-Context-Framework (cf. chapter 5.2) and uses an already existing in- stant messenger as user interface (cf. chapter 5.4.3). The system is aware of user identities, locations and activity states and of the local time. Utilizing this knowledge about the user's context together with meta-information about group structures, the system is able to provide the users with pro-active services they might need to improve their interaction. These services include means for group formation and management, synchronous and asyn- chronous group communication, location awareness and the recognition and support of gath- erings as well as means for context-aware adaptation of one's availability status and a con- text-aware reminder service. The system has reached a stable version and has already been tested in several artificial set- tings. A field test with more users in a real life setting is subject of future work.}},

abstract = {{Concept Mapping is a method for externalizing and reflecting knowledge about real world phenomena. In cooperative settings, concept maps can also be used to aid cooperative learning activities and the development of a common understanding about the mapping subject. This process imposes requirements on tool support that have hardly been addressed in existing concept mapping tools. In this paper, we present a tabletop interface designed to meet these requirements. In an empirical study, the positive effects on the cooperative mapping process facilitated by the proposed system have been shown in comparison to a traditional, screen-based system.}},

In this way, explicit articulation work becomes an integral and essential part of collaboration. Implicit aspects of collaboration have impact on the quality of work results, mainly through social norms and observations of working together. Eliciting those aspects interactively helps in avoiding (mutual) misrepresentations and lack of understanding. Tangible articulation support systems allow aligning mental models of how work should be carried out. Stakeholders can develop a common understanding of collaboration in a semantically open and non-intrusive way. They are not burdened by explication features and diagrammatic notations. We have utilised experiences with model-centred learning theory to support explicit articulation work. According to our field studies, the resulting models can be fed back to current work practices and help in preventing problematic work situations.}},

abstract = {{Elicitation of business process knowledge can be facilitated by visualization of conceptual process models. Models of collaborative business processes with actors participating in different roles are com- plex constructs with flows of individual activities that are coupled via acts of communication. The processes of elicitation in such cases can benefit from separating the modeling process for each role and let ac- tors focus on their own contribution to work and their communication with other roles. This paper identifies concepts for model visualization and modeling support that enable a modeling process distributed across role while maintaining one consistent overall model representation. A prototypical implementation of these concepts using distributed tangi- ble tabletop interfaces is presented and results of exploratory tests are discussed. Based on this results the introduced concepts are refined end extended together with an industry partner to create a table top device which can be used in real world model elicitation scenarios.}},

author = {Mühlburger, Manuel and Oppl, Stefan and Stary, Christian}, 
journal = {VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems}, 
abstract = {{Purpose – Deployment of KMS suffers from low adoption in organizational reality that is attributed to a lack of perceivable added value for people in actual work situations. Poor task/technology fit in the process of knowledge retrieval appears to be a major factor influencing this issue. Existing research indicates a lack of re-contextualizing stored information provided by KMS in a particular situation. Existing research in the area of organizational memory information systems (OMIS) has thoroughly examined and widely discussed the topic of re-contextualization. The article thus examines how KMS design can benefit from OMIS research on approaches for re-contextualization in knowledge retrieval.
Design/methodology/approach – We examine OMIS literature and inductively derive a categorization scheme for KMS according to their strategy of re-contextualizing knowledge. We have validated the scheme validated in a multiple case study that examines the differentiatory value of the scheme for approaches with various re-contextualization strategies.
Findings – The classification scheme allows step-by-step selection of approaches for re-contextualization of information in KMS design and development derived from to OMIS research. The case study has demonstrated the applicability of the developed scheme and shows that the differentiation criteria can be applied unambiguously.
Research limitations/implications – Due to the chosen case study approach for validation, the validation results may lack generalisability.
Practical implications – The scheme enables an informed selection of KMS appropriate for a particular OMIS use case, as the scheme’s attributes serve as design rationale for a certain architecture or constellation of components. Developers can not only select from various approaches when designing re-contextualization, but also come up with rationales for each candidate due to structured representation. Hence, stakeholders can be supported in a more informed way, and design KMS more effectively along organizational change processes.
Originality/value – The article addresses an identified need for systematic characterization of KMS approaches and systems intending to meet the objectives of OMIS. As such, it allows streamlining further research in this field, since approaches can be judged according to their originality, and positioned relative to each other.}},

Process participants are not expected to have modeling skills and usually, they prefer to externalize their knowledge through diagrams that are as simple as possible in terms of both syntax and semantics (‘natural modeling’). Alignment leads to accommodation of novel perspectives on a work process according to the participants’ individual mental models, allowing their implementation in organizational practice after validation.}},

abstract = {{This chapter demonstrates the use of the proposed framework for digital work design and the embedded methods. It shows the mutual interplay of its components for articulating work knowledge, organizational learning, knowledge processing, and preserving design-relevant knowledge. The case studies describe the impact that could be generated through digital design support. The healthcare case demonstrates how meaningful work-model entities evolve in the course of articulation and guide aligned re-structuring of work. It stems from a complex planning process in clinical health treatment requiring the structured elicitation of contextual knowledge from all stakeholders involved to develop working procedures in time-critical situations. The CoMPArE/WP (Collaborative Model Articulation and Elicitation of Work Processes)-case has its focus on alignment when bridging from intuitive or semi-structured models to techno-centric (formal) models that can be executable for some workflow engine. The education case targets educator knowledge involving domain knowledge, didactic competence, and social skills. Finally, the Me2Me2You-case addresses mental model alignment of interaction behavior for executable workflow support from a cascaded interaction perspective.}},

The chapter presents relevant framework constituents, namely humans, technology, and organization of work, while referring to the articulation and alignment processes by socio-technical means. From a dynamic system development perspective, learning support and human-centered representation of knowledge play a crucial role. Their major characteristics are discussed as common ground for the instruments presented in the subsequent chapters.}},

It provides the conceptual underpinnings of the articulation and alignment processes of work process elicitation. We detail relevant insights from different disciplines such as social psychology, cognitive sciences, knowledge management, and computer-supported collaborative work. The individual mental model of accomplishing work tasks, as well as role awareness, is crucial for capturing situated and thus contextual work behavior. For aligning individual mental models, intangible information exchange, and implicit work knowledge needs to be externalized and combined with existing encoded work representations. Such an endeavor lays the ground for co-creating digital work settings and meta-cognitive potential for further developments, in particular, organization learning steps. This chapter provides a corresponding theory-based synthesis. It reflects on methodologically grounded designs of work support and organizational development processes.}},

abstract = {{The design of digital work systems requires stakeholder involvement in generating relevant work knowledge. It starts with articulation, and proceeds with sharing and aligning this knowledge in more or less structured design spaces. Once the ultimate goal is to develop executable processes in evolving systems, such as cyber-physical environments, specifications require stakeholders to become skilled in programming (concepts) for automated model execution. In this chapter, we demonstrate that models can be created on an abstract, implementation-independent level, while still being executable. The so-called ground models serve as boundary objects for iterative prototyping and interactive validation of specific process scenarios or situations. Remaining on this level of description allows tracing diagrammatic models while running their code, thus reducing system complexity to manageable components and architectures.}},

How people deal with interruptions through various kinds of messages from different contexts in their lives is subject to boundary management. Studies suggested that polychronicity, the trait describing one's preference of handling multiple tasks simultaneously, has an impact on how individuals perceive and react to interruptions via digital communication media. This paper examines potential relations between a polychronic orientation and strategies used in boundary management. In an exploratory study, a method for boundary profiling was combined with a scale to measure the polychronic orientation of individuals. The results were examined for possible relationships between them and show that individuals with a polychronic orientation identify a lower number of contexts than individuals with a monochronic orientation. We could also find indications that polychronic individuals have a tendency to find interruptions from other contexts in their lives more acceptable than monochronic individuals.}},

facilitate qualitative assessment in courses. The latter scenario
introduces a short-term usage perspective that can be counterproductive for
establishing sustainable long-term usage practices. In this paper, we
analyse the usage data of the ePortfolio-platform mahara.at with respect to
the prevalent usage patterns. This instance was active from 2007 until 2019
and featured more than 22.000 users from nearly 200 different institutions.
As part of the analysis, we reviewed the activity on the platform on the
basis of users' login behaviour and content creation activities. Activity
data shows that \textbackslashtextasciitilde 50\textbackslash\% of the users used the platform for only half a year
and sustainable usage practices over longer durations of time can hardly be
observed. Both logins and content creations show cyclic patterns which
correspond to the academic year. Based on these indications we conclude
that users used the instance mainly for course-based scenarios rather than

abstract = {{Developing mathematical skills requires the opportunity to practice and receive immediate, individualized feedback on the misconceptions or mistakes made in the problem-solving process. Huge progress has been made in the last years in the design of feedback systems for fundamental math education. Applied mathematics education for engineering disciplines, however, lacks a large body of examples with pre-worked solution paths and known difficulty, which are necessary for providing learners with (semi-)automated feedback. This is mostly due to the need for domain-specific and situated tasks, which are not that widely deployable as generic items. The effort required for designing appropriate items, validating them in terms of the appropriateness for specific learning outcomes, and calibrating their difficulty cannot be borne by individual teachers and is also hardly justifiable for commercial providers of item pools. In this paper, we strive to show how these challenges can be addressed via a community approach to item design and calibration, supported by the methods from the computerized adaptive testing field.}},

abstract = {{Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, digital technologies for distance learning have been used in educational institutions worldwide, raising issues about social implications, technological development, and teaching and learning strategies. While disparities regarding access to technical equipment and the internet (‘the digital divide’) have been the subject of previous research, the physical learning environment of learners participating in online learning activities has hardly been investigated. In this study, the physical-spatial conditions of learning environments, including technical equipment for distance learning activities and their influence on adult learners in academic continuing education during initial COVID-19 restrictions, were examined. Data were collected with an online survey sent to all students enrolled in an Austrian continuing education university, together with a small number of semi-structured interviews. A total of 257 students participated in the survey during the 2020 summer semester. Our findings provide insights in two infrequently-studied areas in learning environment research: the physical learning environment for online learning and the learning environment in academic continuing education. The study illustrates that students in academic continuing education have spacious living conditions and almost all the equipment necessary for digitally-supported learning. According to gender and household structure, significant differences were found regarding technical equipment, ergonomic furniture and availability of a dedicated learning place. In their learning sessions during the restrictions, students reported low stress levels and positive well-being. The more that they perceived that their physical learning environment was meeting their needs, the higher were their motivation and well-being and the lower was their stress. Their learning experience was further improved by the extent to which they had a separate and fixed learning place that did not need to be coordinated or shared with others. The study contributes to the literature on creating conducive learning environments for digitally-supported online learning for adult learners.}},

title = {{Acceptance and Intended Use of a Feedback System for Fencing}}, 
booktitle = {Proceedings of WCPAS 2022 \& IACSS 2022}, 
abstract = {{Introduction Previous research has highlighted the importance of reaction time and precision in fencing (Gutiérrez-Cruz et al. 2015; Sorel et al. 2019). However, the systems as proposed by Gutiérrez-Cruz et al. and Sorel et al. are costly as they require high speed cameras (Vicon), force plates and a video projector. Consequently, their integration into routine training sessions is difficult. However, also the commercially available system, which has recently been investigated for its validity and reliability (De Giorgio et.al. 2021) has some technological limitations, similar to the other systems: e.g., the target area is constructed using solid materials. Consequently, hits do not feel natural for athletes. Furthermore, the system does not check whether a point was actually made using the electronics of the weapon. Additionally, the feedback capabilities of the systems are limited. In particular, none of the systems allows tracking of progress of recorded metrics.
Methods
In order to overcome the limiting factors identified, we created a novel system composed of an ESP32 microcontroller with an accompanying smartphone app built using Pegasos (Dobiasch et al. 2019). Two configurations of the system are shown in Figure 1. The system allows a wide variety of different training modes. Furthermore, all data is stored in a web-platform. Using this platform each training session can be analyzed. For example, reaction time for individual hits as well as mean reaction time for the whole session can be investigated. Furthermore, the system allows tracking progress.
We evaluated the system using a qualitative study along the dimensions of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al. 2003). Nine persons (see Table 1) participated in the evaluation after getting an introduction to the device and using it in a session.
Results
Performance Expectancy: While less experienced fencers focused on more practical aspects, such as getting feedback on their reaction time, more experienced fencers expressed their intention of substituting existing training elements with the device. Some emphasized the importance of getting feedback and easy setup. Effort Expectancy: All participants reported that they feel that the system is easy to use. Social Influence: All but one participant noted that they think their peers would think using the system would be beneficial for them. However, some expressed concerns whether their coach would approve of this technology. Hedonistic Motivation: Having fun using it was expressed. However, some expressed the need of competitive elements for sustained fun. Facilitating Conditions: Participants noted that the factors important to them are an easy setup and little time required. Behavior Intention: all participants expressed their intention to use it. Most prominently, the idea of integrating it into training sessions as a way of passing time between other exercises.
Discussion
Unsurprisingly, the results of our investigation show that an easy setup as part of effort expectancy and facilitating conditions is important. While simple feedback seems to be sufficient for an introduction to the system, the answers show that more elaborate feedback and interactive modes have an influence on the intention for continued use.}},
