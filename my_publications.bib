Looking at those elements beyond a requirements engineering perspective to deliver products and services, human-centric value chain and their analysis can help in apprehending how an enterprise creates valuable elements through a set of core and support activities. Both are assumed to contribute to the sustainable existence of the producing organization in competitive and continuously changing environments, based on products or services for which customers are creating revenues. Representational carriers of work knowledge are business processes, as functional activities of work force transform goods and information. Value creation resides in the context-rich design and execution of work processes rather than the processed or created assets. Although value created in this way has a tangible component, a second component, the intangible part, is of equal importance. Both need to be externalized and represented for (re-)design. In this chapter, various methodologically grounded instruments are introduced, ranging from individual to collective elicitation, and tackling tangible and intangible transactions among concerned stakeholders.}},

Process participants are not expected to have modeling skills and usually, they prefer to externalize their knowledge through diagrams that are as simple as possible in terms of both syntax and semantics (‘natural modeling’). Alignment leads to accommodation of novel perspectives on a work process according to the participants’ individual mental models, allowing their implementation in organizational practice after validation.}},

It stems from a complex planning process in clinical health treatment requiring the structured elicitation of contextual knowledge from all stakeholders involved to develop working procedures in time-critical situations. The CoMPArE/WP (Collaborative Model Articulation and Elicitation of Work Processes)-case has its focus on alignment when bridging from intuitive or semi-structured models to techno-centric (formal) models that can be executable for some workflow engine. The education case targets educator knowledge involving domain knowledge, didactic competence, and social skills.

The individual mental model of accomplishing work tasks, as well as role awareness, is crucial for capturing situated and thus contextual work behavior. For aligning individual mental models, intangible information exchange, and implicit work knowledge needs to be externalized and combined with existing encoded work representations. Such an endeavor lays the ground for co-creating digital work settings and meta-cognitive potential for further developments, in particular, organization learning steps.

abstract = {{The design of digital work systems requires stakeholder involvement in generating relevant work knowledge. It starts with articulation, and proceeds with sharing and aligning this knowledge in more or less structured design spaces. Once the ultimate goal is to develop executable processes in evolving systems, such as cyber-physical environments, specifications require stakeholders to become skilled in programming (concepts) for automated model execution. In this chapter, we demonstrate that models can be created on an abstract, implementation-independent level, while still being executable. The so-called ground models serve as boundary objects for iterative prototyping and interactive validation of specific process scenarios or situations. Remaining on this level of description allows tracing diagrammatic models while running their code, thus reducing system complexity to manageable components and architectures.}},

How people deal with interruptions through various kinds of messages from different contexts in their lives is subject to boundary management. Studies suggested that polychronicity, the trait describing one's preference of handling multiple tasks simultaneously, has an impact on how individuals perceive and react to interruptions via digital communication media. This paper examines potential relations between a polychronic orientation and strategies used in boundary management. In an exploratory study, a method for boundary profiling was combined with a scale to measure the polychronic orientation of individuals. The results were examined for possible relationships between them and show that individuals with a polychronic orientation identify a lower number of contexts than individuals with a monochronic orientation. We could also find indications that polychronic individuals have a tendency to find interruptions from other contexts in their lives more acceptable than monochronic individuals.}},

introduces a short-term usage perspective that can be counterproductive for

the prevalent usage patterns. This instance was active from 2007 until 2019

As part of the analysis, we reviewed the activity on the platform on the
basis of users' login behaviour and content creation activities. Activity
data shows that \textbackslashtextasciitilde 50\textbackslash\% of the users used the platform for only half a year
and sustainable usage practices over longer durations of time can hardly be
observed. Both logins and content creations show cyclic patterns which
correspond to the academic year. Based on these indications we conclude
that users used the instance mainly for course-based scenarios rather than
as a lifelong-learning portfolio.}},

Huge progress has been made in the last years in the design of feedback systems for fundamental math education. Applied mathematics education for engineering disciplines, however, lacks a large body of examples with pre-worked solution paths and known difficulty, which are necessary for providing learners with (semi-)automated feedback. This is mostly due to the need for domain-specific and situated tasks, which are not that widely deployable as generic items. The effort required for designing appropriate items, validating them in terms of the appropriateness for specific learning outcomes, and calibrating their difficulty cannot be borne by individual teachers and is also hardly justifiable for commercial providers of item pools. In this paper, we strive to show how these challenges can be addressed via a community approach to item design and calibration, supported by the methods from the computerized adaptive testing field.}},

While disparities regarding access to technical equipment and the internet (‘the digital divide’) have been the subject of previous research, the physical learning environment of learners participating in online learning activities has hardly been investigated. In this study, the physical-spatial conditions of learning environments, including technical equipment for distance learning activities and their influence on adult learners in academic continuing education during initial COVID-19 restrictions, were examined. Data were collected with an online survey sent to all students enrolled in an Austrian continuing education university, together with a small number of semi-structured interviews. A total of 257 students participated in the survey during the 2020 summer semester. Our findings provide insights in two infrequently-studied areas in learning environment research: the physical learning environment for online learning and the learning environment in academic continuing education. The study illustrates that students in academic continuing education have spacious living conditions and almost all the equipment necessary for digitally-supported learning. According to gender and household structure, significant differences were found regarding technical equipment, ergonomic furniture and availability of a dedicated learning place. In their learning sessions during the restrictions, students reported low stress levels and positive well-being. The more that they perceived that their physical learning environment was meeting their needs, the higher were their motivation and well-being and the lower was their stress. Their learning experience was further improved by the extent to which they had a separate and fixed learning place that did not need to be coordinated or shared with others. The study contributes to the literature on creating conducive learning environments for digitally-supported online learning for adult learners.}},

title = {{Acceptance and Intended Use of a Feedback System for Fencing}}, 
booktitle = {Proceedings of WCPAS 2022 \& IACSS 2022}, 
abstract = {{Introduction Previous research has highlighted the importance of reaction time and precision in fencing (Gutiérrez-Cruz et al. 2015; Sorel et al. 2019). However, the systems as proposed by Gutiérrez-Cruz et al. and Sorel et al. are costly as they require high speed cameras (Vicon), force plates and a video projector. Consequently, their integration into routine training sessions is difficult. However, also the commercially available system, which has recently been investigated for its validity and reliability (De Giorgio et.al. 2021) has some technological limitations, similar to the other systems: e.g., the target area is constructed using solid materials. Consequently, hits do not feel natural for athletes. Furthermore, the system does not check whether a point was actually made using the electronics of the weapon. Additionally, the feedback capabilities of the systems are limited. In particular, none of the systems allows tracking of progress of recorded metrics.
Methods
In order to overcome the limiting factors identified, we created a novel system composed of an ESP32 microcontroller with an accompanying smartphone app built using Pegasos (Dobiasch et al. 2019). Two configurations of the system are shown in Figure 1. The system allows a wide variety of different training modes. Furthermore, all data is stored in a web-platform. Using this platform each training session can be analyzed. For example, reaction time for individual hits as well as mean reaction time for the whole session can be investigated. Furthermore, the system allows tracking progress.
We evaluated the system using a qualitative study along the dimensions of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al. 2003). Nine persons (see Table 1) participated in the evaluation after getting an introduction to the device and using it in a session.
Results
Performance Expectancy: While less experienced fencers focused on more practical aspects, such as getting feedback on their reaction time, more experienced fencers expressed their intention of substituting existing training elements with the device. Some emphasized the importance of getting feedback and easy setup. Effort Expectancy: All participants reported that they feel that the system is easy to use. Social Influence: All but one participant noted that they think their peers would think using the system would be beneficial for them. However, some expressed concerns whether their coach would approve of this technology. Hedonistic Motivation: Having fun using it was expressed. However, some expressed the need of competitive elements for sustained fun. Facilitating Conditions: Participants noted that the factors important to them are an easy setup and little time required. Behavior Intention: all participants expressed their intention to use it. Most prominently, the idea of integrating it into training sessions as a way of passing time between other exercises.
